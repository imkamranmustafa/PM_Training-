# Simple Multi-Agent Chat System (Student Assignment)

## Overview
This repository implements a minimal multi-agent chat system where a `Coordinator` (Manager) orchestrates three specialized agents:

- `ResearchAgent`: simulates information retrieval from a pre-loaded knowledge base.
- `AnalysisAgent`: performs comparisons, simple calculations, and reasoning.
- `MemoryAgent`: structured memory with keyword search and a simple vector similarity layer (in-memory).

The system demonstrates:
- Agent coordination and sequencing.
- Structured memory with metadata and vector search.
- Trace logs and confidence scoring.
- Five sample scenarios saved in `outputs/`.
